Mira will leverage Hyperbolic's [GPU marketplace](http://app.hyperbolic.xyz/compute), which optimizes and aggregates global GPU infra to make compute more accessible and affordable. Mira's flow-based AI infrastructure platform will seamlessly integrate with Hyperbolic's GPU marketplace, which unites computing power from data centers, mining farms, personal devices, and on-premises machines worldwide. This pooled power supports AI services by providing essential computational resources, enabling researchers and startups to access GPUs at a fraction of the cost. This integration addresses current AI development bottlenecks, paving the way for more diverse and innovative applications. Developers will gain access to approximately 80 high-powered open-source models, all running on Hyperbolic's distributed GPU network. 

This collaboration serves the communities of Mira and Hyperbolic by enabling:

1. **Cost-Effective Scaling**: Hyperbolic's affordable GPU marketplace enables efficient scaling of AI applications, reducing financial barriers to entry.
2. **Access to Cutting-Edge Models**: Mira's platform provides developers with tools to compete with larger incumbents, including the integration of [Hyperbolic's Llama 3.1 405B model](https://app.hyperbolic.xyz/models).
3. **Enhanced Performance**: The partnership ensures high-quality integration, delivering the reliability and speed essential for advanced AI development.
4. **Acceleration**: By removing technical barriers and fostering open collaboration, this partnership accelerates the pace of AI innovation.

As part of its B2B expansion, Mira is also leveraging Hyperbolic's GPU infrastructure to power Klok. Klok is an AI-powered Crypto Copilot built on and by Mira as its flagship application. It offers structured data & AI-driven insights into crypto allowing users to navigate the crypto ecosystem with ease.

This partnership between Mira and Hyperbolic represents the first step in a long-term vision to create a decentralized, open-access AI ecosystem that empowers developers and researchers worldwide.

“Hyperbolic empowers the Mira community to run the latest open source model seamlessly through the Mira SDK and Hyperbolic’s distributed GPUs”, stated Stone Gettings, Head of Partnerships at Mira. Dr. Jasper Zhang, CEO and Co-founder of Hyperbolic, also said, “This partnership is a testament to our commitment to making AI more accessible and scalable. By combining Mira’s innovative platform with our robust GPU infrastructure, we’re enabling developers to push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI, driving forward a more open and decentralized future for AI technology. 

Mira invites developers, builders, and researchers to explore the capabilities of this enhanced infrastructure. By leveraging Mira's flow-based platform and Hyperbolic's GPU resources, developers can participate in and benefit from the growing AI economy.
