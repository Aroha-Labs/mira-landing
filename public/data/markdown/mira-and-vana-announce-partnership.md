Mira will integrate Vana on a flow level, adding more data resources for developers and enhancing the reliability and sophistication of AI products that can be created leveraging Mira's SDK. Vana's robust ecosystem of partners and DAOs in their data liquidity layer will be seamlessly integrated into Mira's ecosystem, enabling developers to access a wide array of curated data sources while respecting user privacy and ownership.

This collaboration serves the communities of Mira and Vana by enabling:

1. **Enhanced AI Product Development**: Developers using Mira Flows gain access to Vana's diverse data sources, including curated Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter, dating, and web3 analytics data.
2. **User-Owned Data Monetization**: Vana's community gains new opportunities to monetize their curated data through integration with Mira's flows.
3. **Customizable AI Solutions**: As Mira opens its console for custom flow development, AI contributors will be able to seamlessly leverage Vana data sources, customize open-source models, and choose the right inference partners.
4. **Expanded Development Options**: The partnership drives usage of Vana's data liquidity layer while giving Mira developers the ability to build more specialized flows for specific verticals.

As part of its expansion, Mira is also leveraging Vana's data resources to enhance Klok, Mira's AI-powered Crypto Copilot. Soon, anyone interested will be able to see this partnership in action through the Mira console as it approaches testnet, by interacting with Klok.

This partnership between Mira and Vana represents a significant step towards creating a decentralized AI ecosystem that empowers developers and researchers worldwide while respecting user data ownership.

"This partnership enables developers to access a wide array of curated data sources, empowering them to build more sophisticated AI products. By seamlessly integrating Vana's data resources at a flow level, we're unlocking new possibilities for both user-owned data monetization and the customizable AI solutions that can be built as a result", said Stone Gettings, Head of Partnership at Mira.
