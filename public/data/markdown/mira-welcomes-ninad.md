At Uber, Ninad led the core marketplace product for the company's global food and grocery delivery business. His prior experience includes multiple GM and product leadership roles at Amazon across AI, hardware, and marketplace businesses. This unique blend of experience in marketplace dynamics and enterprise SaaS products aligns perfectly with Mira's goals of attracting developers and enterprise users to its decentralized AI ecosystem.

“I am excited to join Mira and contribute to its mission of making AI accessible to all through decentralization. AI will impact the world greatly and the potential of Mira's platform to transform how we develop and deploy AI is immense. I am excited to lead the product and research that will drive this innovation forward. Together, we will create tools and solutions that empower developers and businesses to leverage AI in new and impactful ways”, states Ninad. 

His focus will be on leading product development and research that empowers developers and businesses to leverage AI in novel and impactful ways.

As Mira continues to set new standards for how AI is developed, utilized, and maintained, the focus remains on minimizing complexities for both Web2 and Web3 developers. Developers and creators can publish Mira Flows, a new AI primitive, for users to utilize for a usage-based fee. This permissionless fee is then attributed and re-distributed to contributors through the Mira blockchain. 

Mira invites developers, builders, and researchers to explore the capabilities of its infrastructure and participate in the ecosystem.
